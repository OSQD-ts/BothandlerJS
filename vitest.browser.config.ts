// It needs a Chromium binary that a fresh checkout does not have, and a default suite
// that fails until somebody runs `npx playwright install` is a suite people learn to
// skip. Run it with `npm run test:browser`; CI runs it in a job that installs the
// browser first.
//
// Single-threaded and unbounded in time because each test drives a real page: parallel
// workers would fight over the one dashboard these share, and a cold browser launch is
// slower than vitest's default patience.
